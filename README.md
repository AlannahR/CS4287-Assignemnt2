# CS4287-Assignment2
CNN


1. Objectives
 To implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based on popular CNN architectures such
LeNet, AlexNet, GoogleLeNet, VGG, Inception, ResNet, Xception, SENet, FCNs, YOLO, and
hybrids.

 Explore the impact of varying hyperparameter(s).


2. Submission
Submit a pdf describing

1. The Data Set with visualisations of distributions and correlations and any pre-processing
applied (5 marks).

2. The network structure, distinguishing feature(s) of the CNN architecture, weight initialisation,
batch normalisation, regularisation, transfer learning, and other hyperparameters. For example,
if opting for ResNet, a few paragraphs on Residual learning is necessary given that this is a
distinguishing feature. (7.5 marks)

3. Results – plots, top 5 accuracy, precision and recall, or other such as Mean Average Precision
(5 marks).

4. Evaluation of the results (5 marks).
5. 
6. Impact of varying hyperparameter(s) and/or data augmentation in the case where overfitting is
detected (7.5 marks).


Submit a Jupyter notebook with the code where:
 The book is named CS4287-Prj2-ID1-ID2

o Where ID1 and ID2 are the student id numbers of the team members


 The first line in the book is a comment with names and ID numbers of the team members

 The second line in the book should be a comment stating if the code executes to the end without
an error.

 The third line in the book should be a comment with a link to the original source where you
opted to reuse an existing implementation.

 Every critical line of code MUST be commented by YOU. To demonstrate a deep
understanding of that code.


3. Sample Data Repositories

 Wikipedia’s listing of data repositories


4. Notes and Guidelines
 This assignment constitutes 30% of the total marks awarded for this module.
 You will work in a team of 2.
 Submission deadline is 10:00 Monday 15th November (Week 11).
 Submission is via the Sulis Assignment tool.
 You may use the same dataset leveraged for Assignment 1 but do pay attention to overfitting.
 You may build the CNN layer by layer, or opt to use high level functions in frameworks such
as Keras or other. See https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/ for ResNet functions.
 You MAY be required to provide the lecturer with a walk through of your project submission
during an interview in Teaching Week 11-12. The project will be awarded an F grade if a
walkthrough is not provided when requested to do so.
 Programming language is Python.
